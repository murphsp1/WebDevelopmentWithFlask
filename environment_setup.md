cd to project root


    virtualenv venv

This setups the virtual environment named venv

     source venv/bin/activate

This runs the activate script, turning on the virtual environment. With Oh-My-ZShell, I see the following prompt:

    (venv)âžœ  WebDevelopmentWithFlask git:(master)

Now it is time to load up flask and install into the venv

    pip install flask
