cd to project root


    virtualenv venv

This setups the virtual environment named venv

     source venv/bin/activate

This runs the activate script, turning on the virtual environment. With Oh-My-ZShell, I see the following prompt:

    (venv)âžœ  WebDevelopmentWithFlask git:(master)

Now it is time to load up flask and install into the venv

    pip install flask


## Flask contexts that are available: ##

current_app (Application context) - the application instance for the active application
g (Application context) - a Python dictionary for the app for temporary storage during the handling of a request (reset with each request)
request [request context] - the request object that encapsulates the contents of a HTTP request sent by the client.
session [request context] - the user session, a dictionary that the app can use to store values that are remembered between requests.

Request hooks - register functions to always run at certain points in the request cycle

- before_first_request - register to run before first request is handled
- before_request - run before each request (maybe a database connection)
- after_request - run after each request, if no unhandled exceptions occur
- teardown_request - run after each request regardless of unhandled exceptions

The app.config dictionary is a general purpose dictionary to store config data for the app and its extensions.

## SQLAlchemy
Changes are stored in a db session that must be committed before anything happens in the DB. It is a local Python cache of everything that must change in the DB

## Flask.Mail

(venv) $ export MAIL_USERNAME = < Gmmail username > 
(venv) $ export MAIL_PASSWORD = < Gmail password >
